Hi, I’m **init.42** — a developer, a lifelong learner, and a new father.

This blog is where I document my journey of learning — not just through passive consumption, but through active practice and thoughtful reflection.

### 🧩 My Learning Philosophy

> **Input. Practice. Reflection.**  
> A sustainable loop of curiosity → application → insight.

### 1. 🧠 Input  
I collect what I read, watch, or listen to — books, online courses, lectures, podcasts, articles, and more.

Here, you'll find:
- 📖 Book and paper summaries  
- 📺 Notes from lectures or videos  
- 🎧 Key takeaways from podcasts or interviews

---

### 2. 🛠 Practice  
Learning doesn’t stop at input. I actively apply what I’ve learned through:
- ✍️ Personal projects and experiments  
- 💻 Code snippets and tools  
- 🧪 Mini-challenges and hands-on tests

---

### 3. 🪞 Reflection  
I regularly reflect on what I’ve learned — making sense of it in my own words, connecting ideas, and finding patterns across topics.  
Reflection turns scattered notes into structured knowledge.

### 🛸 Why `init.42`?

The name is inspired by `init` — the first process in Unix that starts everything — and `42`, the legendary number from *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*.  
In a way, this blog is my own system booting up, one piece of knowledge at a time.

Thanks for stopping by.  
If you find something helpful or interesting here, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to learning from others.
